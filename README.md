# Advent of Code Challenge Repository

A repository containing folders for a submission of each day's Advent of Code challenge. I will be solving the problems on my own and then comparing my solutions to those generated by a large language model trained by OpenAI. This will serve as a way for me to evaluate my own progress and see how my solutions stack up against a state-of-the-art language model.

**Note:** This `README.md` file was generated by a large language model trained by OpenAI (chatGPT).

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual online event in which participants solve coding puzzles to advance through a story. The event typically runs from the first of December through Christmas Day, with a new puzzle being released each day.

To participate in Advent of Code, you will need to sign up on the official website and obtain the puzzle input for each day. You can then use the code in this repository to solve the puzzles and advance through the story.

## About This Repository

Inside each folder, there are two Jupyter notebook files:

- `my_results.ipynb`: This file contains my solutions to the challenges for that day.
- `chatGPT_results.ipynb`: This file contains solutions to the challenges for that day generated by a large language model trained by OpenAI.
